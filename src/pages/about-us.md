    - paragraph: Our client focused approach still lies at the very heart of our
        business. As specialists in commercial insurance we can offer the care
        and technical expertise your business needs to ensure it is always fully
        covered. Our extensive relationships with the major insurers as well as
        the more specialist providers means that we can provide you with the
        highest possible levels of cover at the most competitive prices. We also
        provide for the personal insurance needs of our commercial clients.
    - paragraph: In a time of mass consolidation within the insurance industry our
        independent status means that we can offer you truly independent advice
        and solutions for you and your business.
    - paragraph: We are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority
        (FCA). Our Firm Reference Number is 481844. We are also members of the

        needs. Every single person at bpw plays a vital part in making sure our
        clients get the very best service and support.
    - paragraph: We are not a large, faceless organisation where you will never speak
        to the same person twice. Instead, we believe in the personal touch. All
        of our clients have dedicated members of staff working for them. This
        helps us understand our clientsâ€™ insurance needs better than anyone
        else.
    - paragraph: We are also proud to have the Investors in People accreditation and
        are committed to upholding the principles on which the standard is
        based. Our ongoing dedication to the Investors in People Standard is
        evidence of our commitment to all our staff and clients, as well as our
        goal of continuous improvement in everything we do.
